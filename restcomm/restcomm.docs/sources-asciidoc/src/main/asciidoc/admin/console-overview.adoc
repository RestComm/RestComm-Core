The {product} Console is a great way to perform repetitive {product} tasks in a orderly manner. In this guide, you will learn how to use some of the features available to create Applications, Clients, Phone Numbers, Check Call Logs, Messages Logs, Recordings.

= {product} Login Interface

Make sure you use the correct {product} Organization URL that you first defined when you created your {product} Account and that you received in the sign up email. It should look like `https://{mydomain}.restcomm.com/login`

= {product} Console Dashboard

This is the default page after you log in where you can get latest news and features as well as a usage overview of your {product} Account activity.

= {product} Account Settings

When you click on the drop down representing the name of your Account then `Account` at the top right corner of the window, as shown in the screenshot below, you will be able to :

* Retrieve your Account SID and Auth Token which are required to use the <<../api/index.adoc#API,{product} API>> to place Outbound Calls or send SMS by example.
* Retrieve your Account Information such as First Name, Last Name, Email, Role.
* Change your Account password 
* Create Sub-Accounts.

[NOTE]
All of the information presented visually under the {product} Account Settings is also accessible through the <<../api/account-api.adoc#account,{product} Accounts API>>

= {product} Applications

This Section allows you to create, delete, update and search for your {product} Applications. When you start the workspace is empty, future updates to the platform will list a number of demo applications to get you started more quickly

image:./images/console-13.png[console-13]

When you click on the `Add New App` button on the right corner, you can create a new application which leads you to the screen below allowing you to choose between three ways of doing so:

image:./images/console-14.png[console-14]

* *Create a URL Application* : This option allows you to create a <<../rcml/index.adoc#RCML,{rcml} Application>> which will be hosted externally outside of {product} and contain the logic of your application to be executed upon receiving a call or a message. The <<../rcml/index.adoc#RCML,{product} Markup language>> needs to be used to design your application. This option will let you define a name, URL of the {rcml} application hosted outside of {product} and the type of application (Voice or SMS). This option is the longest to get you started and will require that you understand {product} better, it's usually recommended to start by creating a Visual Designer Application to get started more quickly.
* *Create a Visual Designer Application* : This option allows you to create a <<../rvd/index.adoc#RVD,{product} Visual Designer Application>> which will be hosted by {product} and contain the logic of your application to be executed upon receiving a call or a message. Visual Designer is a quick and great way to create Voice and Messaging applications with minimal or no programming skills. This option will let you define a name and the type of application (Voice or SMS). This option is the quickest to get you started and you can already choose from a pre-existing set of templates to get started even more quickly.
* *Import a Visual Designer Application* : This option allows you to import a pre-existing <<../rvd/index.adoc#RVD,{product} Visual Designer Application>> which will be hosted by {product} and contain the logic of your application to be executed upon receiving a call or a message. Visual Designer is a quick and great way to create Voice and Messaging applications with minimal or no programming skills. This option will let you define a name and the type of application (Voice or SMS).

= {product} Numbers

This Section allows you to create, delete, update and search for your {product} Numbers. When you start with {Restcomm} this section is empty, future updates to the platform will list a number of demo numbers to get you started more quickly. This section also allows you to link a Number to an Application created in the previous section

[[register-number]]
== Register Number

When you click on the `Register Number` button, you will see a screen similar to the screenshots below. This will allow you to create a new phone number that can be attached to a {product} application.

You can register two types of Numbers:

* *SIP Number*: Those numbers are virtual numbers which are not tied to any Origination PSTN Provider and can be reached via a registered {product} Client using SIP or WebRTC. Type the name of the SIP Number you want to create in `SIP Address` field and give it a name you can remember easily in the `Friendly Name` field at the top and then click on the `Register` button, which will lead you to the `Edit Number` section below to link your newly purchased number to a {product} application your previously created
image:./images/console-3-1.png[console-3-1]
* *Provider Number*: Those numbers are numbers which are tied to an Origination PSTN Provider and can be reached via a landline or mobile phone as well as through a registered {product} Client using SIP or WebRTC. You need to first search for a number from the Provider to purchase it which requires you to select a `Country` in the dropdown, an optional `Number` to filter further if you are looking for a specific number pattern, optional capabilities (SMS or Voice), and optional type (Landline, Mobile, Toll-Free) to further filter the search, then click on the Search icon. Once you found a number in the list, click on `Register Number`, which will lead you to the `Edit Number` section below to link your newly purchased number to a {product} application your previously created
image:./images/console-3-2.png[console-3-2]

[[edit-update-number]]
== Edit/Update Number

Editing a {product} Number can be done after purchase or creation or by clicking on the number in the `Numbers` list, the screenshot below shows how you can edit a SIP Number but is applicable to a Provider Number as well. You can set or update the Voice or SMS Application to which the number is attached. 

image:./images/console-5.png[console-5]

You have two options for attaching the application to a number:

* *Application*: You can use this dropdown list to select one of the applications you previously created using the Visual Designer.
* *{rcml} URL*: You can use this field to copy the URL of where your {rcml} Application is hosted.

In addition to that, you can also set *{rcml} URL* to link another Application for a number of advanced options in clicking on the `Advanced` link for both SMS or Voice Applications.

image:./images/console-5-1.png[console-5-1]

* *Voice or SMS Fallback URL*: The {rcml} URL that {product} will request if an error occurs retrieving or executing the Application set previously.
* *Voice or SMS Callback URL*: The URL that {product} will request to pass status parameters (such as call ended or SMS delivered) to your application.
* *Voice REFER URL*: The {rcml} URL that {product} will request when receiving a SIP REFER request to this number. Read the <<../tutorials/Restcomm_SIP_Refer_Support.adoc#REFER,{product} REFER Tutorial>> to learn more about {product} support for REFER.


= {product} Clients

This Section allows you to create, delete, update and search for your {product} Clients. When you initially start with {product}, this section has a default Client that you can use whose username and password is the same that you used to login to your {product} Account.

A {product} Client is an abstraction for storing credentials related to a typical SIP or WebRTC (using SIP Over Websockets) endpoint that can use through traditional SIP Softphone or hardphone or through our <<../sdks/index.html#SDKs,{product} WebRTC SDKs>> (Currently in **Preview**)

== Edit/Update {product} Client

You can change the {product} client password and also attach an application to the client (in the same manner that is described above to attach an application to a number) which will be executed upon any outbound calls done by the {product} client.
