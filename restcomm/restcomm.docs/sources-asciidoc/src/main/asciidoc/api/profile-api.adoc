[[Profiles]]
== Profiles

Profiles allow to associate behavior configuration  to specific Accounts or Organizations. Once a Profile
is associated with such Entity, the next session (USSD/Voice/SMS) attempt related to that
Entity will use the Profile configuration to tweak the service logic behavior.

During session creation the service logic will try to find the associated Profile 
based on this criteria, until a Profile is found:

. Profile associated to current Account
. Profile associated to parent Account
. Profile associated to related Organization
. Default Profile

The Default Profile is pre-provisioned in the system, and can't be modified from the
REST API. The Default Profile Sid is "PRae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf"

Since the Profile configuration is expected to grow as required, the Profile entity
is defined by a JSON schema, rather than regular properties, representing a 
document used as generic container. 

The REST API will validate well-known contains
of the document that are used by RestcommConnect during session handling logic. The
rest of the document will not be validated, with the only constraint of a 
maximum size limitation of 10MB. This means the REST API consumer may use the Profile
document to store/retrieve any kind of arbitrary information as long as the document is 
a valid JSON document.

All Profiles REST API is only accesible by SuperAdmin credentials. With the exception
of reading the associated Profile, where all Roles are allowed if the queried profile
is associated with the requesting Account credentials.
