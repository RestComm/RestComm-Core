=== Migration Notes
// Things to consider during migration from previous release

*Important Note* Migration notes are applicable to Restcomm-Connect versions before 8.4.0. If you have upgraded to 8.4.0 already, you can ignore the notes here.

With the release of Restcomm-Connect 8.4.1, we provided a new method in the Organization REST API which can be used to migrate existing clients using clear text password to hashed password.

Restcomm-Connect 8.4.1, will work just fine with either hashed or clear text client passwords (this might change in the future by forcing only hashed passwords)

As part of the 8.4.1 release, we also provided a set of DB backup/restore bash scripts <<configuration/MySQL_Backup_Restore_Scripts.adoc#mysql-backup-restore-scripts,Mysql backup/restore scripts>>, that we recommend to use during the migration process.

==== Migration steps - part 1

Follow the steps below to upgrade DB schema

* Use full backup database script to backup database - follow <<configuration/MySQL_Backup_Restore_Scripts.html,Mysql backup/restore scripts>>
* Use database schema upgrade scripts to move DB schema to the latest - follow <<configuration/How to use Mysql schema upgrade scripts.adoc#mysql-schema-upgrade,How to use Mysql schema upgrade scripts>>

*At this point, you can upgrade Restcomm-Connect instance.*

==== Migration steps - part 2

Migration of client passwords from clear text to hashed password, can be done using Organization REST API, see <<api/organization-api.html#organization,Restcomm API – Organization>>.

Given you want to migrate clients of an Organization follow the steps below to backup `restcomm_clients` table and migrate client passwords from clear test to MD5 algorithm

* Use Client full backup script to backup `restcomm_clients` table - follow <<configuration/MySQL_Backup_Restore_Scripts.html,Mysql backup/restore scripts>>
* Use Client per Org backup script to backup `restcomm_client` table for the clients that belond to that specific Organization - follow <<configuration/MySQL_Backup_Restore_Scripts.html,Mysql backup/restore scripts>>
* Use Organization REST API to migrate clients of the given Organization - check <<api/organization-api.html#organization,Restcomm API – Organization>>

Repeat the process for all the Organizations as required

==== Rollback steps
In case something goes wrong during the migration/upgrade process, you can rollback changes and run the previous version of Restcomm-Connect

Follow the steps below:

1. Use previously generated Clients table backup files and the scripts provided to restore client passwords to clear text - follow <<MySQL_Backup_Restore_Scripts.adoc#mysql-backup-restore-scripts.html,Mysql backup/restore scripts>>
2. Stop 8.4.1 instance
3. Start old version instance.
